#WELCOME TO BUDGET TRACKER

"""
Features


Track Income & Expenses:

Allow users to input income and categorize expenses (e.g., rent, groceries, utilities, etc.).
Store these as variables and update them regularly.


Use Data Types & Variables:

Use appropriate data types for different inputs (e.g., floats for income/expenses, strings for categories).


Conditionals:

Ensure budget limits are not exceeded and warn users if they are spending too much in certain categories.
Offer a comparison if monthly spending exceeds income.


Functions:

Create modular functions for adding income, recording expenses, and viewing a summary of finances.
Use built-in functions like sum() for total spending.


Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples:

Store transactions using a dictionary (category as key, amount as value).
Keep track of past expenses with a list, where each is a tuple (category, amount, date).


Exceptions:

Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid input types (e.g., entering a string when a number is expected).
